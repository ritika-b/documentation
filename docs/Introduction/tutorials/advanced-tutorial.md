# Overview <!-- omit in toc -->

In this tutorial you will learn how to request data from a public API in a smart contract. This includes understanding what Core adapters and External adapters are and how Oracle Jobs use them. You will also learn how to find the Oracle Jobs and Adapters for your contract and how to request data from an Oracle Job.

# 1. How does the request and receive cycle work for API calls?

The request and receive cycle describes how a smart contract requests data from an oracle and receives the response in a separate transaction. If you need a refresher, check out the [Basic Request Model](../architecture-request-model/).

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the [Random Numbers](../intermediates-tutorial/) tutorial, you requested randomness from a VRF oracle, then await the response. The fulfilment function is already given to us from the `VRFConsumerBase` contract, so oracles already know where to send the response to. However, with API calls, the contract itself *defines* which function it wants to receive the response to.

Before creating any code, you should understand how Oracle jobs can get data on-chain.

# 2. What are initiators?

[**Initiators**](../initiators/) are what start, or initiate, a job inside an Oracle. In the case of a Request and Receive job, the [RunLog](/docs/initiators/#runlog) initiator monitors the blockchain for a request from a smart contract. Once it catches a request, it initiates the job. This runs the adapters (both core and external) that the job is configured to run eventually returning the response to the requesting contract.

# 3. What are Adapters?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Each oracle job has a configured set of tasks it needs to carry out when it is run. These tasks are defined by the [**Adapters**](../core-adapters/) they support. Adapters are split into two subcategories:

Each oracle job has a configured set of tasks it needs to carry out when it is run. These tasks are defined by the [**Adapters**](../core-adapters/) they support. We split Adapters into two subcategories:
>>>>>>> update tutorials format

- **Core Adapters** - These are adapters that come built-in to each node. (examples: HttpGet, EthUint256, etc)
- **External Adapters** - These are custom adapters built by node operators and community members, which perform specific tasks like calling a particular endpoint with a specific set of parameters (like authentication secrets that shouldn't be publicly visible smart contracts).

## Core Adapters

If a job needs to make a GET request to an API, find a specific unsigned integer field in a JSON response, then submit that back to the requesting contract, it would need a job containing the following Core Adapters:
- [HttpGet](../core-adapters/#httpget) - Call the API
- [JsonParse](../core-adapters/#jsonparse) - Parse the JSON and retrieve the desired data
- [EthUint256](../core-adapters/#ethuint256) - Convert the data to Ethereum compatible data type (uint256)
- [EthTx](../core-adapters/#ethtx)  - Submit the transaction to the chain, completing the cycle.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Let's walk through a real example, where you will retrieve 24 volume of the [ETH/USD pair](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD) from the cryptocompare API.

Let's walk through a real example, where we retrieve 24 volume of the [ETH/USD pair](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD) from the cryptocompare API.
>>>>>>> update tutorials format

1. [HttpGet](../core-adapters/#httpget) - Calls the API and returns the body of an HTTP GET result for [ETH/USD pair](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD).
```json
{"RAW":
  {"ETH":
    {"USD":
      {
        ...,
        "VOLUMEDAYTO":953806939.7194247,
        "VOLUME24HOUR":703946.0675653099,
        "VOLUME24HOURTO":1265826345.488568
        ...,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. [JsonParse](../core-adapters/#jsonparse) walks a specified `path` (`"RAW.ETH.USD.VOLUME24HOUR"`) and returns the value found at that result. Example: `703946.0675653099`

3. [Multiply](../core-adapters/#multiply) parses the input into a float and multiplies it by the 10^18. Example: `703946067565309900000000`

4. [EthUint256](../core-adapters/#ethuint256) formats the input into an integer and then converts it into Solidity's `uint256` format. Example: `0xc618a1e4`

5. [EthTx](../core-adapters/#ethtx) takes the given input, places it into the data field of the transaction, signs a transaction, and broadcasts it to the network. Example: [transaction result](https://kovan.etherscan.io/tx/0xf36ec811db8bde1245b6aa16bc052d4fbab287b220cf194bb91ae452f1fad084)

**Note: Some core adapters accept parameters to be passed to them to inform them how to run.** For example: [JsonParse](../core-adapters/#jsonparse) accepts a `path` parameter which informs the adapter where to find the data in the JSON object.

Let's see what this looks like in a contract:

## Contract Example

```solidity
{% include samples/APIRequests/APIConsumer.sol %}
```

<div class="remix-callout">
  <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/APIRequests/APIConsumer.sol" target="_blank" class="cl-button--ghost solidity-tracked">Deploy this contract using Remix ↗</a>
    <a href="../deploy-your-first-contract/" title="">What is Remix?</a>
</div>

Let's walk each of the components of this contract:
1. Constructor: This sets up the contract with the Oracle address, Job ID, and LINK fee that the oracle charges for the job.
2. `requestVolumeData` functions: This builds and sends a request - which includes the fulfillment functions selector - to the oracle. Notice how it adds the `get`, `path` and `times` parameters. These are read by the Adapters in the job to perform the tasks correctly. `get` is used by [HttpGet](../core-adapters/#httpget), `path` is used by [JsonParse](../core-adapters/#jsonparse) and `times` is used by [Multiply](../core-adapters/#multiply).
3. `fulfill` function- This is where the result is sent upon the Oracle Job's completion.

> 📘 Important
>
> The calling contract should own enough LINK to pay the specified fee (by default 0.1 LINK). You can use [this tutorial](../fund-your-contract/) to fund your contract.

This is an example of a basic HTTP GET request. However, it requires defining the API URL directly in the smart contract. This can, in fact, be extracted and configured on the Job level inside the Oracle.

## External Adapters

Here are some examples of external adapters:

1. Market data: [AlphaChain](https://market.link/adapters/c3a722dd-fb6c-413f-923c-e53d2df26620?network=1)
2. Real-world events: [SportsData](https://market.link/adapters/e7874f1a-2c35-4624-9a7a-644ce9d89ea4?network=1), [COVID Tracker](https://market.link/adapters/f423d46b-1bfb-4cad-9038-7934eef353eb?network=1)
3. Social media proofs: [MUBC Retweet Verifier](https://market.link/adapters/8fba59b1-f639-4d0a-9b01-7adff9b74442?network=1)
4. Cryptocurrency aggregators: [Coingecko](https://market.link/adapters/e43efb14-55b5-4adc-a807-f6f1c035f415?network=1), [CoinAPI](https://market.link/adapters/f4d69a08-f3dd-46e7-b4b8-3d2fb620c033?network=1)

These external adapters, along with many others, can be found on [Chainlink Market](https://market.link/search/all?network=42).

If all the parameters are defined within the Oracle job, the only thing a smart contract needs to define to consume it is:

- JobId
- Oracle address
- LINK fee
- Fulfillment function

<<<<<<< HEAD
This will make your smart contract much more succinct and the `requestVolumeData` function from the code example [above](#contract-example) would look more like this:

This makes our smart contract much more succinct and the `requestVolumeData` function from the code example [above](#contract-example) would look more like this:
>>>>>>> update tutorials format

```solidity
function requestVolumeData() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {
    Chainlink.Request memory request = buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, address(this), this.fulfill.selector);

    // Extra parameters don't need to be defined here because they are already defined in the job

    return sendChainlinkRequestTo(oracle, request, fee);
}
```

# 4. How can I use Adapters in my own contract?

Now that you know how core adapters and external adapters are used to construct jobs and how smart contracts can use jobs to make requests let's put that to use!

Head to [Make an Existing Job Request](../existing-job-request/) to see how a smart contract can get any city's temperature using an existing oracle job found on Chainlink Market, without having to specify the URL inside the contract.

Then, using your knowledge of external adapters, find a different adapter on the market, and create another contract that consumes that data. Let us know the cool things you come up with in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2YHSAey)!

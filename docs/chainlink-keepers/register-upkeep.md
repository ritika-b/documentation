## Overview

This guide explains how to register a Custom logic Upkeep that uses a [Keepers-compatible contract](../compatible-contracts). You can either register it from the Keepers App, or from within a contract that you have deployed.

## Register an Upkeep using the Keepers App

</div>

1. **Connect your wallet** using the button in the top right corner and choose a network. For a list of supported networks, see the [Supported Blockchain Networks](../supported-networks) section. The Chainlink Keepers App also lists the currently supported networks.

1. **Click the Register New Upkeep button**
  ![Click Register New Upkeep](/images/contract-devs/keeper/keeper-register.png)

1. **Select the custom logic trigger**

1. **Provide the address of your [Keepers-compatible contract](../compatible-contracts)** You do not need to verify the contract on-chain, but it must be [Keepers-compatible](../compatible-contracts/).

1. **Complete the required details:**

    - **Upkeep name**: This will be publicly visible in the Keepers app.
    - **Gas limit**: This is the maximum amount of gas that your transaction requires to execute on chain. This limit cannot exceed the `performGasLimit` value configured on the [registry](/docs/chainlink-keepers/supported-networks/#configurations). Before the network executes your transaction on chain, it simulates the transaction. If the gas required to execute your transaction exceeds the gas limit that you specified, your transaction will not be confirmed. Developers also have the ability to update `performGasLimit` for an upkeep. Consider running your function on a testnet to see how much gas it uses before you select a gas limit. This can be changed afterwards.
    - **Starting balance (LINK)**: Specify a LINK starting balance to fund your upkeep. See the [LINK Token Contracts](/docs/link-token-contracts/) page to find the correct contract address and access faucets for testnet LINK. This field is required. You must have LINK before you can use the Keepers service.
    - **Check data**: This field is provided as an input for when your `checkUpkeep` function is simulated. Either leave this field blank or specify a hexadecimal value starting with `0x`. To learn how to make flexible upkeeps using `checkData`, see the [Flexible Upkeeps](../flexible-upkeeps) guide.
    - **Your email address**: This email address will be encrypted and is used to send you an email when your upkeep is underfunded.

1. **Click `Register upkeep`** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

Your Upkeeps will be displayed in your list of Active Upkeeps. You must monitor the balance of your Upkeep. If the balance drops below the **minimum balance**, the Keepers Network will not perform the Upkeep. See [Manage Your Upkeeps](../manage-upkeeps) to learn how to manage your Upkeeps.

## Register an Upkeep using your own deployed contract

You can dynamically create and manage Upkeeps from within your own dApp. To do this you will need to keep track of the Upkeep ID as your contract will use this to subsequently interact with the Keepers registry. The following example displays a smart contract that can create an Upkeep and determine the Upkeep ID. Note your contract should be Keepers-compatible you will need [ERC-677 LINK](../../link-token-contracts/) to fund the Upkeep. You can also program your Upkeep to check its own balance and fund itself by interacting with the registry.

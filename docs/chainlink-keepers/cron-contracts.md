# What is Job Scheduler?

The Chainlink Keepers Job Scheduler schedules jobs that use the Chainlink Keepers Network to automatically execute your smart contract functions at specific times. After you register your Job Scheduler with the [Chainlink Keepers network](https://keepers.chain.link/new), the decentralized Keepers network monitors and executes your scheduled jobs.  

# Job Scheduling Tutorial

Use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for this tutorial. To learn more about Remix and how you can use it to deploy a smart contract, see the [Getting Started guide](/docs/deploy-your-first-contract/).

You will also need MetaMask or other another wallet that is compatible with Remix with some testnet tokens of choice. See the [MetaMask tutorial](/docs/deploy-your-first-contract/#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) if you need help setting up a wallet.

Before you deploy your application to a mainnet, test the tutorial on one of the [supported testnets](/docs/chainlink-keepers/introduction/#supported-blockchain-networks).

## Creating a Job Scheduler contract

To deploy an on-chain Job Scheduler contract, we will use the externally audited and pre-deployed Chainlink  [CronUpkeepFactory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/factories/CronUpkeepFactory.sol) smart contract. This is called the [Factory pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1zZo4O_Ong), where one contract deploys another contract. To deploy your Job Scheduler (`CronUpkeep`), [open the `CronUpkeepFactory.abi` in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/Keepers/CronUpkeepFactory.abi). The ABI is the application binary interface that is used to interact with the smart contract that has been deployed to the network.

![Remix ABI Cron](/images/keepers/cron-1.png)

Select the **DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS** icon in the left-hand navigation bar and set **Environment** to *Injected Web3*. Paste the address of our deployed `CronUpkeepFactory` contract in the **At Address** box and select the **At Address** button. You can find the [addresses](#contract-addresses) for deployed `CronUpkeepFactory` contracts in the [Resources](#resources) section. You will then be able to view callable functions of `CronUpkeepFactory`. Select the `newCronUpkeep` button and follow the prompts in MetaMask to confirm the transaction. When the transaction is complete,  a transaction hash will appear in the terminal. This points to the creation of your Job Scheduler.

## Finding the address of your Job Scheduler

Copy the transaction hash and open it in the scanner of the chain you are working on. Once you have found it, select the **Internal Txns** tab. This displays the contract creation and contract address in the `To` field. Note the address and transaction hash for future use.

## Interacting with your Job Scheduler

To interact with your Job Scheduler contract, [open the `CronUpkeep.abi` in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/Keepers/CronUpkeep.abi). Select the **DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS** icon on the left and paste the address of your Job Scheduler contract in the **At Address** box, and then select the **At Address** button. Accept the prompts after which the contract interface will open in the bottom left of Remix.

## Scheduling a Job

To schedule a new job, use the function `createCronJobFromEncodedSpec`. This function has three inputs:

+ The target address of the smart contract you want to automate
+ The [function signature](#function-signature), or the encoding of the function, you want to call
+ The [encodedCronSpec](#encodedcronspec) encoding of your specified time interval. Encodings allow you to save repeated gas costs of having your contract calculate them during execution.

### Function Signature
The Function Signature (or bytes handler) is the first four bytes of the Keccak-hash used in EVM chains to encode a function. You can use the following Python script to retrieve the function signature.

```{python}
#Install pycryptodome from https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/
#pip install pycryptodome
from Crypto.Hash import keccak
import binascii

#Our example smart contract function is called increment()
#and remember to include the brackets
#Note Job Scheduler will not pass a parameter
functionToEncode = 'increment()'

#Calculate the Hash
functionEncoding = keccak.new(data=functionToEncode.encode('UTF-8'), digest_bits=256).digest()

#Decode to UTF-8 and return first 4 bits (8 characters)
functionSig = binascii.hexlify(functionEncoding).decode('UTF-8')[:8]
print("Function Signature:", functionSig)
#Should return Function Signature: d09de08a
```

### EncodedCronSpec

The EncodedCronSpec is an encoded version the time interval specification used to schedule a job.

```json
Cron jobs are interpreted according to this format:

  ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
  │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
  │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
  │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
  │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Monday to Sunday)
  │ │ │ │ │
  │ │ │ │ │
  │ │ │ │ │
  * * * * *

  Special limitations:
    * there is no year field
    * No special characters: ? L W #
    * lists can have a max length of 26
    * No words like JAN / FEB or MON / TUES
    * No <division operators> (eg */5 * * * *)
*/
```

For example, if we want to create a job that runs every hour we specify the Cron expression as `0 * * * *`. For a job that runs every weekday at 9am the equivalent Cron expression would be  `0 9 * * 0-4`. For a job that runs at 5pm on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the equivalent Cron expression would be `0 17 * * 0,2,4`.

For our example, our contract to execute every 5 minutes. We will encode the following Cron expression:

```json
"0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * *"
```

Paste this expression into the `cronStringToEncodeSpec` function in Remix and run the function. This will produce the following result:

```

```json
<your target address>, <your function specification>, <your encodedCronSpec>
```
Replace the values and paste the snippet above into the `createCronJobFromEncodedSpec` function in Remix and execute the function. Once executed, you can call the `getActiveCronJobIDs` to see if your job has been registered. You can execute the `getCronJob` function to view the details of your job played back. You can add multiple jobs on this contract in this fashion, and also use the other in your Job Scheduler to delete jobs or pause and unpause the Scheduler. However, you must register your Job Scheduler with the Chainlink Keepers network for it to be monitored and executed.


## Setting up Chainlink Keepers

Because the deployed contract is already [Keeper-compatible](../compatible-contracts), you can immediately [register the contract for upkeep(/docs/chainlink-keepers/register-upkeep/). Provide the address of your Job Scheduler contract in the **Upkeep address** field. For gas limits, specify the upper limit of gas that your target function will use.

> ❗️ Gas Limits
>
> The `KeeperRegistry` enforces a cap for gas used both on-chain and off-chain. See the [Keepers Network Overview](../overview/) for details. The caps are configurable and might change based on user feedback. Be sure that you understand these limits if your use case requires a large amount of gas.

After you register your contract, you can view your upkeep in the [Chainlink Keepers App](https://keepers.chain.link/). The *Upkeep History* displays **Perform Upkeep** events for all registered jobs on your Job Scheduler contract. To ensure that Chainlink Keepers continues to monitor your Job Scheduler, maintain a sufficient LINK balance on your Upkeep.
